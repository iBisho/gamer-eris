## Mission

*Gamer Speaking:*
I want to be the very best!
Like no one ever was!
To stay online 24/7 is my real test!
To moderate the servers is my cause!
I will join servers across the land.
Watching far and wide!

### Technology Used

For this project, I've decided to use the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) language. TypeScript is a type-safe superset of JavaScript, and has allowed me to ensure that there will be less bugs in this codebase.
To store data, I use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). This is used to store information critical to the functionality of the bot.
